<p>One of my responsibilities as a <a href="http://digitalfellows.commons.gc.cuny.edu" target="_blank">CUNY Digital Fellow</a> is to lead workshops for the GC community on various topics related to the Digital Humanities. Previously, I worked with Erin Glass to run a workshop on data management tools (check out the <a href="http://commons.gc.cuny.edu/wiki/index.php/Data_Management_Tools">wiki</a> we created for the workshop) and one on reference management software (specifically Zotero and Mendeley). </p>
<p>Today I will be leading a workshop on Git and GitHub (really, though, it's focused on GitHub). The target audience is non-programmers. And while I've been using GitHub for a while and am fairly comfortable with basic operations, my skill level is limited by the quality of stackexchange posts and the little I've read of the git-scm documentation/book. So this will be an interesting experience.</p>
<p>In any case, since I put together a set of slides to use during the workshop, I wanted to post them to share. I was originally going to put them together in HTML using the awesome <a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/" target="_blank">reveal.js</a>, and maybe I still will in the future, but for now a PDF will have to suffice.</p>
