Keith K. Miyake is a Chancellor's Postdoctoral Fellow in the American Studies Department at the University of California, Davis under the mentorship of Dr. Julie Sze.

He received his Ph.D. from the Earth and Environmental Sciences Program at the Graduate Center, City University of New York (CUNY), with fellowship assistance from the CUNY Advanced Research Collaborative, the Center for Place, Culture and Politics, and the CUNY Graduate Center Digital Initiatives. His [research interests]({{ '/research/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}) include political geography, environmental justice, critical race and ethnic studies, urban planning, and political economy. His work as a public scholar engages the __racial environmental state__ as a contradictory source of both foreclosure and possibility in relation to antiracist struggles for social and environmental justice.

From 2013 to 2016, Keith served as a [GC Digital Fellow](http://digitalfellows.commons.gc.cuny.edu){:target='_blank'}, working on various digital projects, workshops, and research collaborations supporting [digital research initiatives](http://gcdi.commons.gc.cuny.edu){:target='_blank'} and the digital humanities at the Graduate Center, CUNY. Prior to that, he spent two years serving as a joint assistant for the [Center for Place, Culture and Politics](http://pcp.gc.cuny.edu){:target='_blank'}, the [Committee on Globalization and Social Change](http://globalization.gc.cuny.edu){:target='_blank'}, the [Committee for the Study of Religion](http://studyofreligion.gc.cuny.edu){:target='_blank'}, and the [Committee for Interdisciplinary Science Studies](http://sciencestudies.gc.cuny.edu){:target='_blank'}, at the Graduate Center, CUNY.

Keith has [taught]({{ '/teaching/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}) undergraduate courses including [Introduction to Geography]({{ '/geh101' | prepend: site.baseurl }}) at Lehman College and [Asians in the Americas]({{ '/asam210' | prepend: site.baseurl }}) (Intro to Asian American Studies) at Hunter College. He was also a collaborator on two separate National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) funded summer institutes: a K-12 educator program titled "[Asian Americans in New York: Film and Literature](http://asianamericanyc.hunter.cuny.edu/){:target='_blank'}," and a CUNY-centered institute titled "[Building Asian American Studies across the Community College Classroom](https://buildingaas.commons.gc.cuny.edu/){:target='_blank'}."

Prior to his graduate study, Keith worked as an environmental engineer, designing and monitoring systems used in the cleanup of soil and groundwater pollutants, and writing environmental reports on contaminated sites throughout Southern California. This experience exposed him to the inner workings of environmental policy administration as well as the ways in which language and knowledge are used as tools of both domination and resistance within these spheres.

Keith received his Bachelor of Science degree with High Distinction in Engineering from [Harvey Mudd College](http://www.hmc.edu){:target='_blank'}, in Claremont, CA. During his undergraduate education, he was heavily involved with the Claremont Colleges Interdisciplinary Asian American Studies program (IDAAS) and worked to create an Asian Pacific Islander mentoring program at Harvey Mudd (API-SPAM). This work heavily influenced his ongoing involvements in social justice activism related to labor, transportation, immigration, and the environment.

Keith was born and raised in, and remains deeply committed to, Southern California's San Gabriel Valley.
