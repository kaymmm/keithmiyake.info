<p>This article here from Forbes (not something I usually read) presents an interesting notion that is relevant to the course. And that notion is that entrepreneurial immigrants weren&#8217;t particularly so in their homelands but decided to become so because the crappy treatment they felt they endured from their employers. It&#8217;s an interesting notion:</p>

<p>This is an article about ethnic studies today, and why they are (still) important. They promote new and different ways of thinking and looking at history, and benefit not just members of the ethnicity being taught but other students as well.</p>

<p>This political cartoon from World War II depicts Japanese lining up along the west coast en masse, with one in a hut with the sign &#8220;Honorable Fifth Column&#8221; distributing explosives to the rest, so they can take down the United States from within. A fifth column is a group of people who infiltrate and undermine a larger group, in this case Japanese Americans and the United States. The line &#8220;Waiting for the signal from home&#8230;&#8221; suggests that this was their plan along, that the only reason  It shows how people generally felt about their presence in America at the time, and easily summarizes what some people think about Muslim Americans today.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.asian-nation.org/korematsu.shtml">http://www.asian-nation.org/korematsu.shtml</a></p>
<p>This article draws parallels between the decisions in Korematsu v. United States, which justified Japanese internment, and Dasrath v. Continental Airlines, Inc., a 2002 Supreme Court case regarding racial profiling with removing potential terrorists from commercial flights. It explains how both decisions use similar justifications and reasoning, insisting it&#8217;s not based on race, that national security is more important, and that since inaction could get people killed, there&#8217;s no time to thouroughly consider everything.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In class we discussed the keywords for Asian Americans in the 1960s, 70s, 80s and 90s.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.unlearningracism.org/writings/lib_theory.htm">http://www.unlearningracism.org/writings/lib_theory.htm</a></p>
<p>This piece by Ricky Sherover-Marcuse talks about liberation, oppression, differences and conditions between groups and class etc. <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">His definition of liberation is &#8221; both the undoing of the effects and the elimination of the causes of social oppression. The achievement of human liberation on a global scale will require far-reaching changes at the institutional level and at the level of group and individual interactions. These changes will involve transforming oppressive behavioral patterns and &#8220;unlearning&#8221; oppressive attitudes and assumptions.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://my.vanderbilt.edu/perkins/files/2011/09/empintro.proquest.pdf">https://my.vanderbilt.edu/perkins/files/2011/09/empintro.proquest.pdf</a></p>
<p>This piece by Douglas Perkins and Marc Zimmerman discusses the theory of empowerment. I like how they talk about the empowerment process and empowerment outcome. Empowerment process includes leadership and decision making in organizations and communities. Empowerment outcome includes control and resource mobilization skills. &#8220;Community level empowerment outcomes might include evidence of pluralism, and existence of organizational coalitions, and accessible community resources. &#8221; (570)</p>
<p>Empowerment allows the enhancement of group participation and the accomplishment of goals in organizations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe there&#8217;s a definite contrast between the two keywords. For liberation, there is a sense of undoing what&#8217;s already been there and done. For empowerment, there is a sense of achieving communication and hoping for the combination of great leadership and group participation in all organizational groups.</p>

<p>The above link seemed relevant to Junaid Rana&#8217;s paper. It doesn&#8217;t present any surprising ideas, and doesn&#8217;t even necessarily focus on Asians, but I chose this article because it seemed relevant to the paper by giving accounts of the sort of hate crimes and discrimination that American muslims were subjected to post 9-11.  By giving a more vivid face to the matter, it became all the more real and I felt I better understood the issue of &#8220;moral panic&#8221; at a social level.</p>
<p>http://www.access-to-culture.eu/upload/Docs%20ACP/THECULTURALCOMPONENTOFCITIZENSHIPlayout.pdf<br />
[Only section 2]</p>
<p>In relation to &#8220;Youth, Culture, Citizenship, and Globalization&#8221; the above link Better defines cultural citizenship.  It brings up the interesting case of 19th century San Francisco, where many chinese immigrants never became full &#8220;citizens&#8221; because the did not need to interact outside their own communities.  They instead remained in immigrant towns where customs would be accepted and they wouldn&#8217;t have to Americanize.  I found this interesting because it defied the idea in &#8220;Youth, Culture, Citizenship, and Globalization&#8221; that cultural citizenship necessarily &#8220;becomes an important construct&#8221; for immigrants.  Even today, we see conclaves of nearly isolated subcultures in America, and so long as those cultures are not already part of American culture or so much as trying to be, they are retaining their own cultural citizenship, even within foreign borders.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This first article I&#8217;m sharing aims to decry the unchecked power of the U.S. executive branch and the inherent hazards thereof. The primary evidence herein is the staggering mountain of corpses that the U.S. has left in the wake of its military misadventures, the implications of which are surely a vital lens through which one must look in order to come to a more complete understanding of the whole terrorism thing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alternet.org/investigations/executive-branch-evil-and-lawless?page=0%2C2">http://www.alternet.org/investigations/executive-branch-evil-and-lawless?page=0%2C2</a></p>
<p>The second article comes from The Economist. It covers a survey conducted by the Pew Research Centre of 38,000 Muslims in 39 countries. Among the survey&#8217;s questions are whether respondents  are in favor of Sharia law and whether they think those who leave Islam should be executed. Some countries perform better than others. In any event, the overall results are harrowing. It makes for great evidence for those who would like to wield a more well informed islamophobia.</p>

<p>This blogger Kala Burke wrote a little nice article about her reflection on the Lisa Lowe piece connected to a book called &#8220;Lucy&#8221; by Jamaica Kincaid. The character of Lucy (same name as me, funny),  is an Antiguan girl, who moved to America to become an au pair , which by definition is ,&#8221; a domestic assistant from a foreign country working for, and living as part of, a host family.&#8221; Since her move, she has been longing Antiguan culture and it applies to “certain identification and relation to [her] homeland,” which cannot be lost or forgotten&#8221;&#8221;. But then she also finds herself adatping to the U.S culture, therefore an example of hybridity.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.helium.com/items/1475727-what-is-psychological-displacement" class="broken_link">http://www.helium.com/items/1475727-what-is-psychological-displacement</a></p>
<p>A brief article on psychological displacement. I thought out of all displacements we&#8217;ve talked about in class, this one stood out the most.</p>
<p>Angela Diggs defines it as &#8221; a cataleptic defense mechanism whereas the mind redistributes effects from an entity felt to be harmful or unacceptable to a thing felt to be acceptable and secure.&#8221; In a way she explains it, it&#8217;s like distributing your emotions on another person. She uses an example of a boy being bullied in school but ignored them and instead displaces his anger on his mother at home. I found this to be very interesting.</p>
