<p>The link above is an article about the expelled of Asians in Uganda in 1972 by Idi Amin, it tells us the reason why president Idi Amin explained his reason for the this act is because he thinks Asians in Uganda threaten their economy and encouraging corruption.  He stated an interesting example that Asians were living there for 70 years and only six Asian women had married to Ugandan men, and he thinks that is one of the examples of how Asian Ugandan were not trusting in Uganda.  Even though some of them have gained Ugandan citizenship but they still living in Asians areas in the towns and not mix socially with African.  This is the first example mention in Junaid Rana&#8217;s &#8220;Labor Diaspora and Global Racial System&#8221;, she tried to use this example to show us  how transnational labors have to face racism and discrimination.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=Ghcd7ZZ6sy4#at=37">Growing Up Muslim in Post 9/11 America</a></p>
<p>This video show us how Muslim were living in fears to social after 9/11 because they were seen as dangerous terrorists by the others.  In Rana&#8217;s piece, there is an example of Changez who have lived in NY for more than 10 years before the world trade center attack in 2001.  He already settled his life in America because even though he married his wife in Pakistan, and he tried to get his wife to immigrate to U.S. once he gained his green card.  It shows that he sees America as the country to be settle down with.  Rana stated his fear of deportation and the climate of racial anxiety that followed 9/11 in relation to Kokoye (girl in the video).  Kokoye came to the U.S. since the age of 5 and she adopted the American culture to go to the state fair every year, but her father refused to bring her to the fair after the world trade center attack because of the climate of racial anxiety that Rana mentions in her piece.</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>The Cold War Origins of the Model Minority Myth</em>&#8221; by Robert Lee mentioned on page 147 that Life magazine&#8217;s descriptions of using Tojo, as the current Premier of Japan during the World War II to represent the Japanese, and how to use him to identify the difference between Japanese and Chinese.   The link above is about the <em>Life</em> magazine that was published in December 22nd, 1941, the time when Japan was invading China.  These two nations were against each other as enemy in WWII.  During WWII,  Americans failed to distinguish these two Asian groups, they cannot tell a Chinese to Japanese.  The purpose of this article is to teach Americans how to &#8220;distinguish friendly Chinese to enemy aliens Japanese&#8221;. Besides the original pictures that was published from the Life magazine, this link also included with the original texts.</p>

<p>Here are the poster and film scene from &#8220;Japanese War Bride&#8221; directed by King Vidor in 1952.  It was mentioned in &#8220;War, the Homeland, and the Traces of Memory&#8221; by David Palumbo-Liu. This movie is about an American Soldier fell in love with a Japanese Red Cross Nurse in Japan, they fall in love with each other and then they went back to Salinas, California together.  Jim Sterling (the American Soldier)&#8217;s family were separated into two different sides, some of them were willing to accept their marriage while some of them opposed.  Vidor&#8217;s tried to point out the contradictions between American and Japanese after the World War II.</p>

<p>These are the Anti- Chinese poster during the 19th century.  During the mid 19th century, many Asians started to immigrate to the U.S. and that brought the attention of public.  Anti- Asians racism started to raise up because of the cultural difference and they blamed the Asians for making them to lose jobs and the spread out of disease because of their style of living.  These posters were used to spread out the Anti- Asians racism, they wanted to kick the Asians out of the U.S. during the mid 19th century.</p>

<p>How-to guide on creating new posts in wordpress: <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_Posts" target="_blank">http://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_Posts</a></p>
<p>A short video covering the same topic: <a href="http://wordpress.tv/2009/01/15/writing-and-publishing-a-post/" target="_blank">http://wordpress.tv/2009/01/15/writing-and-publishing-a-post/</a></p>
<p>To insert media files into your post: <a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/category/media/" target="_blank">http://en.support.wordpress.com/category/media/</a></p>
<p>To insert a gallery of images: <a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/images/gallery/" target="_blank">http://en.support.wordpress.com/images/gallery/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Super simple example: To embed a youtube video, just insert the link to the youtube page, e.g. <code>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWUV9fyc4Rc</code> and your video will magically appear:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/hWUV9fyc4Rc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
