		<description><![CDATA[After SF Chinatown was destroyed in the 1906 earthquake, the city jumped on the opportunity to rebuild it somewhere far away where they wouldn&#039;t have to look at it. The merchant community stopped them by rebuilding Chinatown as a tourist attraction, which is why it&#039;s so famously pretty today. I read that it&#039;s mostly populated by poor immigrants who don&#039;t speak English that well, though it&#039;s still definitely not as bad as it was in the time Shah described.

It&#039;s interesting, how Asians are affected and in some ways shapes by how Westerners perceive them. In this case they managed to exploit it: by hiring white architects to design a new place that looks &quot;Chinese&quot; (it&#039;s not culturally accurate and was never intended to be) they gained some semblance of acceptance in the city.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have been to SF&#039;s Chinatown, and you can breath a sigh of relief; it does not resemble the accounts in Shah&#039;s piece. But such exploitation continues, of course. The workers only need not always be imported now, e.g., Apple factories in China. Yes, it seems capitalism has quite the love affair with cheap, exploitative labor. But is this an intrinsic property of capitalism, or is it a nastier symptom that might be mitigated if the will were present? I wonder.

Also, if Said were my &quot;guide of sorts&quot; to the Orient, I&#039;d throw up my arms in dismay, cursing the heavens for sending me such a pedantic, turgid, dense guide whose penchant for ostentatious banality rivals even mine.]]></description>
