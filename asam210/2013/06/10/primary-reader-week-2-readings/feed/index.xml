    <description><![CDATA[I am agreed that the two articles we discussed are about how race is in related to public policy. Omi and Winant’s “Racial Formation” concentrates more on topics and definitions of racial formation in authors’ own thoughts and opinions.  Omi and Winant stated the definition of racial project which means “an interpretation representation, or explanation of racial dynamic, and an effort to reorganize and redistribute resources along particular racial lines”.  They also define what “color blind” means to them and how racial project in the U.S. is “liberal”.  In Molina’s “Fit to Be Citizens”, it actually states examples of how race is affect by the politics during the 19th century.  Molina concentrates on the health policies were used toward the immigrants, like how the Los Angeles City Health Department used only two racial categories which is “Chinese” and “the rest of the population”, which means they separated Chinese specifically with others because they wanted to state that they are different from others to the public.  They were concerned about Chinese and Japanese immigrants were threatening others’ health issues because they were seen as dirty in public images.  Another example Molina stated is Mexican, Japanese and Chinese were excluded from the benefits of full social participation in the life of their city.  They were limited in wages, working conditions, owning land, accumulating other assets or moving freely in the city for housing.]]></description>
