		<description><![CDATA[Coolies did indeed have an awful lot in life. Organized labor was still fighting for workers&#039; rights back then (but not for Asian Americans), but the only thing distinguishing coolies from slaves was that they were paid *next* to nothing. And if anyone cared about this, it wasn&#039;t because of how coolies were treated but because their presence in the US was essentially slavery all over again.

1. Do we still see Asian Americans being questioned of their identity as American due to their race?
Well, seeing as I spent my elementary and middle school years being teased for not being from America and being asked why I couldn&#039;t go back to Asia, I would have to say yes. And I&#039;m half-white to begin with. Also, their parents couldn&#039;t tell Asians (as in, my mother and the music teacher) apart, and if told they were really different people, assumed she just didn&#039;t want to talk to them. But really, what else do you expect in a racially homogenous, isolated place like lower Manhattan.

2. In what instances can we improve Asian American presence and recognition as full citizens with a full set of rights?
In what instances? Um... politics? I&#039;m not good at this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I fear that this quest for ultimate inclusivity is an exercise in futility. It seems that nothing is holding together America anymore; the society&#039;s coming apart at the seams. So, this raises the question, what it is to even be an American anymore. Our highly polarized political environment can&#039;t even come together on what the facts are. It&#039;s as if the real world and bizarro world have merged into this incoherent entity in which we&#039;re now ensconced. We have to remember, this whole American thing is still pretty new, its multicultural aspect; there&#039;s no real precedent. There definitely is no precedent for this multiculturalism and democracy coexisting. I wonder if they can exist together effectively, if such a diverse population can be represented effectively by a single governing body without opportunistic powers using the fractured electorate to divide the country and enrich themselves. We seem to be failing miserably at it. Maybe a new Constitution is needed. None of this is to say that we shouldn&#039;t try, however. But we should know what it is we&#039;re facing.]]></description>
