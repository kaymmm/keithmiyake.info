    <description><![CDATA[In “The Racial Triangulation of Asian Americans” by Claire Jean Kim, she writes “racial triangulation occurs by means of two types of simultaneous, linked processes: (1) processes of ‘Relative valorization,’ whereby dominant group A (Whites) valorizes subordinate group B (Asian Americans) relative to subordinate group C (Blacks) on cultural and/or racial grounds in order to dominant both groups, but especially the latter, and (2) processes of ‘civic ostracism,” whereby dominant group A (Whites) constructs subordinate group B (Asian Americans) as immutably foreign and inassimilable and Whites on cultural and/or racial grounds in order to ostracize them from the body politic and civic membership (see Figure 1).” I do think that Asian Americans were mistreated as either a middle point between “Whites” and “Blacks” and treated as inferior. I think their status may have been degenerative to some point to uphold white hegemony. In any sense, this very statement is ironic because the other part of Racial Triangulation is “Civic Ostracism” where instead of having a degenerate status; the White population ostracizes the Asian population to treat them as inassimilable. It is consistently transparent that Asian Americans at some point in United States history were either the “middle man” or “the alien” to promote white hegemony and promote the interests of the White population. In other words, it is clear Asian Americans were either “ragged on” or used as a “middle point” to promote the values and interests of a dominant power thereby consistently created the Asian Americans as an inferior race. What are some ways to change this systematic hierarchy of White hegemony and power?]]></description>
