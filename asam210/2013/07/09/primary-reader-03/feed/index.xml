    <description><![CDATA[“Spaces of Mobilizations” is an introductionary essay to a larger book on the same subject, so it makes sense that it would be mostly informative and summarizing. That said, with the way it’s structured, I felt like to some extent its argument is “here are some of the many ways Asian Americans have been involved in social justice in both the past and present, but today there are people who are convinced it never happened, doesn’t matter, and isn’t needed anymore.”

I found “The Four Prisons” to be very thought-provoking with regards to what the protests and movements of the 60s were about and how they’re interpreted. I can&#039;t remember if I already knew that Asian Americans were involved in politics, but if I did know I rarely heard about it, or them, at all, when I read about social movements.]]></description>
