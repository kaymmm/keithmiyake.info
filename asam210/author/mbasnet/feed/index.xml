        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This article by Parrenas  Rhacel Salazar didn&#8217;t  come as surprise to me after living in NYC. We see lots of immigrant worker here who have to struggle and their life style has changed tremendously over time. Salazar is maily focusing on the examination of reproductive labor in the process of globalization. In order to clarify her statement she uses the ideologies of many scholars and feminist as she is talking mostly about the Filipino women in labor in the globalist society. She also talks about class and inequality and how economy play a major role in the life of these women. It is sad how the women&#8217;s work ethic, love and dedication for her family is not praised in their highly patriarchal society.</p>
<p>These international reproductive Filipino worker go through various contradiction. They feel disconnected and lonely for not being able to spend more time with their own family and having to be taking care of others children. Though life is easier in Philippines there is no money and they have to live a hard working life in order to make more money and make a better living for her family.</p>

This article interests me quite as it starts with the poem. To my understanding, through this article she is mostly trying to characterize the Asian American culture by talking about the heterogeneity, hybridity and multicity. She also talks about how the culture and traditions has changed over the period of time especiallythe generations growing here in the American society. No matter what it is Asian American are mostly seen to own more family business and they seem to like living in the community where there is more Asian people. With the story that she provides of the two girls she is trying to state that, culture followed by the immigrant group is somewhat inherited and somewhat modified. She uses poem, stories and theories of some scholars to make a point to her argument. According to Lowe heterogeneity, hybridity and multiplicity are concepts that assist us in critically understanding the material conditions of Asians in the United States, conditions </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'">in excess of the dominant, “orientalist” construction of Asian Americans. Although orientalism seeks to consolidate the coherence of the west as subject precisely through the representation of &#8220;oriental&#8221; objects as homogenous, fixed, and stable, contradictions in the production of Asians and in the no correspondence between the orientalist object and the Asian American subject ultimately express the limits of such fictions</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;font-family: 'Times New Roman'"> (page 68).</span></p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This Article by Jung, Moon -Ho was published in  2006. Asians were treated neither as a black or the while. It seems to me like the Asians were totally invisible in the eyes of the whites when in comes to the rights and liberty. This articles clearly states how the stories of these Asian immigrant workers play an important role in the emancipation of the US borders along with the black and whites. These group of people who is also known as Coolies is considered as the slave was ill treated and welcomed. During the time of slavery thousands of Chinese immigrant were transported for business purposes to the Spanish colonies of Cuba by the US firms. This article is the article which tries to enhance the history of race right from the time they started immigrating to Europe, America, Caribbean&#8230;..</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we have learned in our class last week white Americans are not the only one who discriminate Asians and Asian Americans. African Americans also discriminate and make racial comments towards the Asians and Asian Americans due to their deviant nature. Helen had stated that African Americans viewed Asians as Ugly, heather and violent. In the mean time i came across this you tube video where the Asians never try to fight back,  they can be easily manipulated and they are easy targets as they will not dare go to the authority due to legal status or language barrier. Asians and Asian American are constantly judged based on their culture and ethnicity throughout the country. it is unfathamoble that some of these innocent Asians become the victim of the racism to such and extent that they have even been killed. But this kind of racial treatment hasn&#8217;t stopped over time and the <a href="http://http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&amp;NR=1&amp;v=rOfUKwVXve4" class="broken_link">Asian becomes the target over and over</a> .</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Orientalism a very interesting reading by Edward W said was written in 1978 and published only in 1994 by the vintage. The book seem to have been written during the time of colonization. I believe that Said wrote this for the post colonial studies, European studies or the study of Orientals themselves. This reading by Said portrays the ideology of the Orients ( Mostly East Asian and middle Eastern) in the European world mostly French and the British. Said starts by defining the Orient and Orientalism in different context.</p>
<p>Orientals is the name used for the east Asian or the people from the middle east. The people studying the orient is known as the Orientalism in the European context. The European found the orients culture, civilization and nature very exotic and they were very interested in learning the livelihood of this innocent human decent who were far from the advancement and development from the rest of the western world. According to Said the world was divided into East and West based on civilization by the Europeans during this time. Said mostly talks about the Orientalism if the late 19th and the 20th century. This division based on civilization seems mostly imaginary and artificial. European colonization basically started from the least developing counties of the orients. The Westerners ( Europeans) considered themselves more superior and the orientals as the inferior group of people. They also thought that it was somehow their duty to colonize the East and teach them more about the western world. Orientals were considered to be lazy, crude, irrational and uncivilized as they had a simple living. Henceforth, European marked their superiority by colonizing and using their authoritative rule by living with the Orientals. East and the West mostly hold accounts on Social and Political affiliation in relation to costume, culture and lifestyle of the orients. And Said finds it very crucial to use Michel Foucault&#8217;s notion of a discourse, which states &#8220;The Archaeology of Knowledge and in Discipline and Punish&#8221;, to explain in order to identify Orientalism.</p>
<p>The Orientals seemed too be constantly judged based on their culture, religion and way of living by the European . This conceptualization somehow seem has created a false image on the orientals. As we see how the world sees the Muslim as the terrorist till today. This kind of discrimination as the oriental and occident has created biases among human kind throughout history and it continues to prevail.</p>
<p>Said states that European gained power and self image through the orientals. Orient which was vastly ruled and dominated by the British and in the french was ruled by the American after the world war II. The main purpose of this reading is to state that the the Orient world or group was not created by anyone in particular. Orient according to Said based on my understanding is the land with its own geographical boundaries, culture and history which the Western world found amusing to learn and rule on to gain power!!!!</p>
<p>Well let me know if you guys think that i had made a good point on understanding the reading by Said and if you guys agree or disagree on any points that i have made..</p>
