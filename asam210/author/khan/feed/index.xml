        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Spaces of Mobilization&#8221; is the article about the struggle for social justice in the US by Asian and Pacific Islands. There are several cases about the struggle by them according to the article such as feminists, queers, and labor movement. Aguirre and Lio, the authors, provide readers those struggle for showing Asian and Pacific Islanders&#8217; resistance for social justice and moreover fight against racism, hate crimes, and affirmative action. There are not much of their ideas for the issues but just providing the facts and cases. The authors say that the issues they provide will contribute the literature on  Asian and Pacific Islanders so that this article is more like an informatic article.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Four Prisons and The Movements of Liberation&#8221; is the article about the history of  the Asian American activists. The author, Omatsu, explains their activism in chronological order from 1960s to 1990s. According to the article, many Asian American activists were the parts of the US history and related to political powers like neo-conservatives or Marxists.  I had no idea that Asian Americans were being part of the US history and political powers a long time ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kung Fusion&#8221; is the article about Bruce Lee and his cultural influence among the world and in the history. The author says that Bruce&#8217;s movie being intellectual resources for Communism and Marxism and his movies were like a symbol of the hero fights to the US imperialism and struggle against racial discrimination even in the third world. I didn&#8217;t realized that the Bruce Lee movies were treated like anti-Americanism stuff in the past.I never heard that Bruce Lee intended to make an anti-Americanism movie or he was a anti-american person.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Racial Panic, Islamic Peril, and Terror&#8221; is the article about anti-Muslim racism and the moral panic among the United States since 9/11, 2001. According to the article, after 9/11, many Muslims and people with &#8220;Muslim-like&#8221; features were the targets in violent attacks and assaults and more than a thousand incidents of racial violence were reported. Moreover, Rana, the author of the article says that the violence caused by 9/11 resembled a moral panic among the US population. Moreover, the moral panic was like a racial panic such as the violence against Japanese-American after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Violence and persecution always follow the racial panic and it also acts against cultural differences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;So Our History Doesn&#8217;t Become Your Future&#8221; is the article about US foreign and domestic policies after 9/11 and a racial justice based on terrorism. Naber the author says that the US foreign and domestic policies are based on tolerance and diversity and there is a realty that racialization is not the same for everyone. Moreover, there is also a coalition building for Asian American Politics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Maira&#8217;s article, &#8220;Youte Culture, Citizenship, and Globalization&#8221; is about South American Youth&#8217;s citizenship and their ideas about citizenship and globalization and moreover US foreign policies for Arab Americans. Maira also says that there are several kinds of citizenship defined by political and cultural resources according to her explanation.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Deporting Cambodian Refugee&#8221; is the article that written by Soo Ah Kwon and it is about the deportations for criminal aliens and the youth group called AYPAL running the campaign to end those unjust deportations. According to the article, any criminal aliens who committed a felony must serve a sentence in a prison in US and then return to their countries no matter they are legal or illegal immigrants or permanent US resident. Moreover, after 9/11 several laws such as USA Patriot Law and AEDPA has been established and these laws are mostly targeting racial minority groups and unwanted immigrants. In the article, Kwon tells us the story about Boran the Cambodian refugee and he was the one of the criminal aliens who had returned to Cambodia. With the Boran&#8217;s story, Kwon criticizes the US&#8217; foreign and immigrant policy which is focused more on national security than rights and freedom. United States is well-known as a free country and its diversity in people. I don&#8217;t believe any society that giving up a freedom for gaining a security deserves both and would not be a good society. Moreover, those acts are mostly targeting a minority group and not majority group so that it is not fair to both group and US have to improve her policy which is fair to every people in the country.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The link above goes to the article about the Boston Marathon Bombing and its relation to Racial Formation theory.</p>
<p>According to the article, Tamerlan Tsarnaev and Dzhokar Tsarnaev, the Chechens and also the criminals of the Boston Marathon Bombing are actually Caucasian by definition but</p>
<p>they were classified as non-Caucasian because of the notions of racial identity reproduced by the media in these days. This is the example of the concept of Racial Formation theory</p>
<p>because they were classfied by the social concept based on social (in this case, media) forces.</p>

<p>The link above goes to the article about the racial formation of Asian Americans during 19th and 20th century.</p>
<p>This article explains the  racialization of nationality in the United States along with the history of Asian Americans and it means that they were the part of the minority group</p>
<p>which are the means for racial classification.</p>

<p>Claude Monet &#8211; &#8220;La Japonaise&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edward Said&#8217;s &#8216;Orientalism&#8217; is the article that explains how the west(Europe, North America) understand the east(Asia) and analyzes the stereotypes about Asian people.</p>
<p>According to the article, the west have many stereotypes about the east such as &#8216;All asian people have black hair and slit eyes&#8217;.</p>
<p>and those stereotypes sometimes lead to racism toward Asian people or fantasy about Asia like &#8216;Japonesque&#8217; which are arts based on Japanese drawings.</p>
<p>However, those based on the stereotypes are mostly exaggerated and give wrong concepts of Asia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://arabstereotypes.org/why-stereotypes/what-orientalism">http://arabstereotypes.org/why-stereotypes/what-orientalism</a></p>
<p>the link above goes to the article that defines Orientalism with the Arab stereotypes.</p>
<p>It points out that the west defines the east as different and inferior and shows several examples of Orientalism with the European history.</p>
<p>I chose this article because it explains well about the wrong perception of Arab culture and includes videos about the wrong perception of the Middle East.</p>
<p>In other words, it shows the examples of &#8216;the bad side of Orientalism&#8217;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.marcmaison.com/architectural-antiques-resources/japonism">http://www.marcmaison.com/architectural-antiques-resources/japonism</a></p>
<p>The link above goes to the article that explains Japonism which is the Japanese cultural influence among the European culture.</p>
<p>On the contrary, This shows &#8216;the good side of Orientalism&#8217; which is more like a fantasy about Asian people and/or culture.</p>
