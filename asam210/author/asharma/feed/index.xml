				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week&#8217;s readings focused on Asian American Studies and how they are constantly in change since the begining. The readings for the week talk about what factors influence this change. From all the three reading for the week, I really liked Unemoto&#8217;s chapter 1 &#8220;On Strike&#8221; that was focused on the series of strikes that occured in the San Franciso State College from 1968-69. The strike was conducted by various student leaders of Thris World Liberation Front who with the help of others marched demanding relevant education and easy access to their communiites (Umemoto 24). Accroding to the author, such movements &#8220;produce major changes in the economic or political structure&#8221; and I think, whether in State colleges or not, results in contentious politics (Tilly and Tarrow). What these types of movements especially in colleges result in formation of various organisations which further produce number of activists. </p>
<p>Similarly, the article &#8220;A Full-on CRAASh at Hunter College&#8221; talks about the same. Student of Hunter College wanted relevant education and when denied, took steps that the author talks about very well. Similar situations can also be seen where students often use various propaganda techniques to focus their demands or raise their voices. </p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a video from YouTube and is a trailer of a recently released film called, &#8216;Uploaded: The Asian American Movement&#8217;. What this film foucses is on stererotypes relating to Asian Americans and how these stereotypes are reflected in the media. Also, the film talks about YouTube being a &#8220;space&#8221; of refuge where anybody can raise their voice and protest as the actors are doing in the film.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The three readings that we have for the week relates to the &#8216;War on Terror&#8217;. Amongst all three, I really enjoyed and liked Rana&#8217;s article. These readings specifically look at the changed world after the recent attacks by a group of people follwing and belonging to Islamic faith. In Junaid Rana&#8217;s piece, the author talks about the &#8220;formation of a global racial system that incorporates the &#8220;dangerous Muslim&#8221; as a racial category.&#8221; And again this is a direct result of the concept of Islamic peril developing after recent events from the history. Rana also  argues that such constructions of other racial category- &#8220;dangerous Muslims&#8221; are also used against the ideas of immigration and criminality. What&#8217;s interesting is the role of the State in such matters. During and since right after the 9/11 incident, U.S government according to Rana, designed various policies to contain Muslim immigrants in the United States. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After reading Asian American Displacements by Andreson and Lee I started to think about internal displacements that occur within a country. Internal displacements within a country are often overlooked, but can cause and have a tremendous effect on the society in this globalised world. </p>
<p>Following is a link to a movie page that I came across while searching for internal displacements. &#8216;The Last Train Home&#8217; is about millions of Chinese nationals, especially from rural areas who migrate across the country in search for work. The type of work that they perform is limited to factory work, therefore, mostly seasonal. Such internal migrations cause displacements amongt traditions, language and attacks on the values of family, as seen in the movie. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Both articles by Molina and Omi for this week relate race to the idea of citizenship. Molina in her introduction of her book &#8216;Fit to be Citizens&#8217; specifically talks about the idea of &#8216;Race&#8217; and &#8216;Public Health&#8217; in the city of Los Angeles. She in the introduction focus primarily focuses on this issue from 1879-1939. She starts off by prividing a brief history about the region and talks about how various governmental officials and leaders sometimes play around with racial politics in order to achieve their goals. For examples, as stated in the chapter, in order to imporove the sanitary conditions in the city, it was neccessary to demolish Chinatown. (1). </p>
<p>Molina points out the during the course of these years, only specific populations were being targetted. They were the Chinese, Japanese and also, Mexicans. The city wanted to develop new infrastructure and &#8220;modernise&#8221; itself, and according to them, these minority populations should be displaced from one area to the other. Omi on the other hand, outlines various theories of race and racism in a particular society. She also goes into detail about  the concept of racial politics that I think effects everybody residing in that State. </p>
<p>Clearly, the audience of these are students who are focusing in the field of community planning, developming, race relations, etc. These are also targetted towards those who simply have an interest in thefield and want to inform themselves about the history of race and race relations in the United States. Overall, both authors mainly use historical and statistical data in hoping to prove their arguements and also utilise various analystics. I really enjoyed reading these two pieces and it was very interesting to read and relate the same information to other minority groups. </p>
