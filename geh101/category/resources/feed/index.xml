				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Western Apache Ethnography and GIS Research Experience for Undergraduates</p>
<p>The White Mountain Apache Tribe Heritage Program and the University of Arizona announce opportunities for student participation in the second season of the Western Apache Ethnography and GIS Research Experience for Undergraduates field school, a National Science Foundation-supported program, June 6-July 15, 2011.</p>
<p>Students participating in this REU will contribute to the creation of a Western Apache cultural and historical Atlas. Participants will learn field research techniques that will include:<br />
• Creating research plans and documenting research efforts;<br />
• Conducting archival, interview, survey, and participant-observation research;<br />
• Identifying the locations of historical sites and land modification areas from archival maps, photographs, and land inspections;<br />
• Collecting and conducting initial analysis of qualitative and quantitative data relating to historical and cultural use of landscapes and natural resources;<br />
• Applying Geographic Information Science (GIS) and Global Positioning Systems (GPS) tools and technologies to mapping and field data collection.</p>
<p>These tools will provide a firm analytical foundation for the systematic evaluation of cultural data. Students will design research projects, and will work collaboratively with fellow students, cultural advisors, and Tribal personnel to complete research projects that will result in draft entries for inclusion in the Atlas.</p>
<p>Participants will receive room and board at the Fort Apache/Theodore Roosevelt School campus, and a weekly stipend of $500 ($3,000 total for 6 weeks). Non-local students will be responsible for transportation to and from Tucson at the beginning and end of the program and will be expected to arrive in Tucson by Sunday, June 5, and to depart no earlier than Saturday, July 16.</p>
<p>6 hours of course credit from the University of Arizona will be available to participants who successfully complete the program (ANTH 395B Special Topics in Cultural Anthropology: Application of Geographic Information Systems to Cultural Anthropology and ANTH 495B Special Topics in Cultural Anthropology: Ethnographic Field Methods).  2011 U.A. Summer School tuition and fees are anticipated to be approximately $3,200 for 6 hours of coursework; tuition scholarships may be available. Successful applicants will be required to enroll in the University of Arizona summer school in order to receive course credit for the program.  This will require an admission fee (anticipated to be $50 for Arizona residents/$65 for non-residents) and submission of proof of current MMR vaccination.  Program staff will provide additional information and guidance.</p>
<p>All participants in the National Science Foundation Research Experience for Undergraduates must be enrolled in an undergraduate degree program at an accredited college or university (i.e., have completed courses in an AA/AS or BA/BS program during the spring 2011 term and/or be enrolled for courses for the fall 2011 term).</p>
<p>A total of 8 students will be admitted to this program annually, 2010-2012.  Members of the Western Apache Nations (White Mountain Apache Tribe, San Carlos Apache Tribe, Tonto Apache Tribe, Camp Verde Yavapai-Apache Nation) will be given first consideration for this program, but other Native and non-Native students are encouraged to apply.  Applications received before March 18, 2011 will be given first consideration.  Applications will continue to be accepted until the program is full.</p>
<p>For more information please contact REU Director Dr. Karl Hoerig at <a href="&#x6d;&#x61;&#105;l&#x74;&#x6f;&#x3a;&#107;h&#x6f;&#x65;&#x72;&#105;g&#x40;&#x66;&#x6f;&#114;t&#x61;&#x70;&#x61;&#99;h&#x65;&#x61;&#x72;&#105;z&#x6f;&#x6e;&#x61;&#46;o&#x72;&#x67;">khoe&#114;&#105;&#x67;&#x40;&#x66;&#x6f;&#x72;tapa&#99;&#104;&#x65;&#x61;&#x72;&#x69;&#x7a;ona.&#111;&#114;&#x67;</a>.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chapter 3 of the Getis Textbook briefly discusses the three types of rocks that form the Earth&#8217;s crust. While it mentions the rock cycle, it does not do it justice in terms of explaining its importance in linking the three types of rocks.</p>
<p><a href="http://serc.carleton.edu/NAGTWorkshops/petrology/visualizations/rock_cycle.html">This page</a> provides some great information and animations that better describe the rock cycle and its importance in shaping the Earth&#8217;s physical landscape.</p>
<p>Essentially, the rock cycle is the theory that all minerals on the Earth cycle through the three forms of rock over the course of millions of years. That is, igneous rock first forms from magma that rises from the Earth&#8217;s mantle. It eventually erodes and is carried away as silt, sand, and gravel, which eventually settle in a body of water where it becomes sedimentary rock. As the tectonic plates shift or magma collects within the Earth&#8217;s crust, heat and pressure cause igneous and sedimentary rocks to undergo physical and chemical changes at the molecular level, creating metamorphic rocks.</p>

<p>The Purdue University Online Writing Lab is a wonderful resource for all stages of the writing process for students of all levels. Their sections on outlining and prewriting are particularly useful:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the objectives of the term papers is to think beyond the information found in Wikipedia or the New York Times. This means engaging with current research about the topic to see how other scholars and researchers are thinking about the topic and the types of questions they&#8217;re trying to understand.</p>
<p>To this end, you are required to use at least 1-2 sources from scholarly journal articles, such as those in the Annals of the American Association of Geographers. You can search for articles using <a href="http://scholar.google.com/">Google Scholar</a> or the <a href="http://www.lehman.edu/library/">Lehman College library</a>. If you search Google Scholar from an on-campus computer, you should be able to download a PDF of the article since CUNY provides access to many journal archives. Similarly, if you search from within the Lehman College library website, you should be able to access the articles directly as PDFs.</p>
<p>As usual, if you have questions, please send me an email or speak with me outside of class.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Celina Su, an Urban Studies professor at Brooklyn College, has a great guide to help students with critical reading, writing, and peer-editing. I highly recommend students check out the guide. Even if some of the ideas seem really basic and obvious, it never hurts to be reminded that we should be doing these things on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Check out Celina Su&#8217;s <a href="http://www.burmeserefugeeproject.org/celinasu/reading.html">Reading</a>, <a href="http://www.burmeserefugeeproject.org/celinasu/writing.html">Writing</a>, and <a href="http://www.burmeserefugeeproject.org/celinasu/editing.html">Peer-Editing</a> guides.</p>
<p>Paisley Currah, another Brooklyn College professor, also has a more in-depth <a href="http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/polisci/pcurrah/writing.htm">guide for writing</a> that covers topics such as style, mechanics, using references, as well as developing your arguments.</p>
<p>And per usual, you can always discuss these things with me in person or via email if you find yourself needing additional assistance.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Geopolitics is the politics of international relations, particularly those influenced by geographical factors. A quick look at a map might lead to questions about the relationships between nations in terms of their proximity and possible trade. But maps can also provide much deeper insights into the geopolitical histories of nation states if the establishment of borders is considered.</p>
<div style="width: 291px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Spain_topo.png"><img class=" " title="Spain Topo Map" src="https://i1.wp.com/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Spain_topo.png/696px-Spain_topo.png?resize=281%2C241" alt="Topo map of Spain" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: wikimedia commons http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Spain_topo.png</p></div>
<p>For example, consider the border between France and Spain:</p>
<p>The jagged shape of the border implies that it was likely established along a naturally occurring physical geologic feature, in this case, the border follows the crest of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrenees" target="_blank">Pyrenees Mountains</a>.</p>
<p>What sorts of implications might other types of borders indicate? Straight borders? Borders with a hitch (like that between Spain and Portugal)? Borders that create long sections of land jutting between other countries? Borders that place one nation partially or entirely inside of another country? etc&#8230;</p>
<p>These and other geopolitical border situations are explored in greater detail <a href="http://www.pagef30.com/2009/08/understanding-countries-through-maps.html" target="_blank">here</a>, with some great explanatory maps.</p>

<p>Many of you have probably seen one or more of the maps created by <a href="http://www.sasi.group.shef.ac.uk/worldmapper/" target="_blank">WorldMapper</a> before. Their website contains hundreds of cartograms&#8211;maps that display land area proportional to some independent variable&#8211;to help people better grasp disproportionate distributions of just about any easily quantifiable information.</p>
<p>From the cartograms above, can you match each with the variable expressed in the map? You can see what is represented by each map by hovering the mouse over each image above (it&#8217;s displayed in the alt-text).</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.sasi.group.shef.ac.uk/worldmapper/display.php?selected=75">Petroleum exports</a> (proportion of worldwide net exports of crude petroleum that come from there)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sasi.group.shef.ac.uk/worldmapper/display.php?selected=279">Military spending</a> (proportion of state military spending worldwide spent by each territory in 2002)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sasi.group.shef.ac.uk/worldmapper/display.php?selected=227">HIV infections</a> (proportion of people worldwide aged 15-49 who are infected with HIVliving in each country)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sasi.group.shef.ac.uk/worldmapper/display.php?selected=2">Population</a> (proportion of the worldwide population who live in each country)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sasi.group.shef.ac.uk/worldmapper/display.php?selected=178">Undernourishment</a> (proportion of people worldwide who are undernourished in each country)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sasi.group.shef.ac.uk/worldmapper/display.php?selected=220">Carbon emissions</a> (proportion of total worldwide carbon emissions that were from each country)</li>
