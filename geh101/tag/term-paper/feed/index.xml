<p><span style="font-family:Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif;line-height:24px;font-size:16px">And here are the Term Paper Discussion Questions for this week:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>How does the uneven allocation and use of natural resources factor into the processes (political, economic, and socio-cultural)that shape your topic?</li>
<li>What are the impacts on natural resources (extractive, destructive, or otherwise)?</li>
<li>What is the role, if any, of sustainable planning and development?</li>
<li>What specific populations are affected by your topic and what are their demographic characteristics?</li>
<li>What is the relationship to human migration?</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple of examples of term paper topics were discussed in class (environmental justice in New York and the role of race, space, and place in the development of jazz music). While this paper should reflect your own interests, academic or otherwise, here are some ideas to help get you thinking about how different topics might be considered from a geographical perspective:</p>
<ul>
<li>The journey of a shoe (like the video in class on globalization)</li>
<li>Climate change and shifting coastlines</li>
<li>Human trafficking</li>
<li>Public transportation</li>
<li>Post-Katrina NOLA</li>
<li>The Gulf of Mexico oil spill</li>
<li>Public housing and the collapse of the housing industry</li>
<li>Climate change and glacial melt</li>
<li>Saharan desertification</li>
<li>Invasive biological species</li>
<li>Public spaces and parks</li>
<li>Public art, grafs, and tags</li>
<li>Food, agriculture, livestock, aquaculture</li>
<li>Gender nonconformity</li>
<li>Waste/garbage</li>
<li>Dating and the Internet</li>
<li>Professional sports and their host cities</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p><!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 12.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times} span.s1 {letter-spacing: 0.0px} -->Each student will write a paper on a topic of his or her choosing. Students may work individually or in pairs. The content of the paper will be developed incrementally throughout the course through collaborative discussions during class. The purpose of this paper is to help students relate the geographical ways of thinking introduced in the course to topics of personal interest, and in doing so, develop research, writing, and critical analytical skills.</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;font-size:23px;line-height:35px">Topic</span></p>
<p><!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 12.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times} span.s1 {letter-spacing: 0.0px} -->The topic can be anything the student chooses, however it is the responsibility of the student to demonstrate how geographical knowledge and analysis is useful in understanding the topic. Examples of suitable topics and possible ways of exploring them will be given in class and posted to the course website.</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;font-size:23px;line-height:35px">Length</span></p>
<p><!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 12.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times} span.s1 {letter-spacing: 0.0px} -->The final paper length is expected to be 1,500-2,500 words, not including a bibliography.</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;font-size:23px;line-height:35px">Format and Style</span></p>
<p><!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 12.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times} span.s1 {letter-spacing: 0.0px} span.s2 {text-decoration: underline ; letter-spacing: 0.0px color: #0d00aa} -->Papers must be typed in a 12-point, Times family font (Times or Times New Roman), with double line spacings and 1-inch margins. Formatting should follow the APA style: <a href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/01/">https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/01/</a></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;font-size:23px;line-height:35px">Content and Structure</span></p>
<p><!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 12.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times} span.s1 {letter-spacing: 0.0px} -->The paper should briefly introduce your chosen topic and clearly state a thesis that describes the purpose or argument contained in your paper. You should very briefly (no more than 1 page) describe the topic as though it was being presented to peers who are mostly ignorant about the topic. The body of the paper should use geographic analysis to critically think about one or more aspects of the topic. For example, you might discuss how spatial variations or interactions shape the processes involved in your topic; or how place-specific physical landscape, political, economic, cultural, and social variables are influencing factors; or how factors in one place have uneven consequences for different populations across space and time. This might entail the use of maps/spatial analysis, quantitative data, analysis of current affairs, policy analysis, media critique, or anything else that would enable others to better understand the chosen topic. Finally, the paper should include a discussion of how the topic is relevant within contemporary society and pose questions or topics for further research.</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;font-size:23px;line-height:35px">Sources and References</span></p>
<p><!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times} p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 12.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times} span.s1 {letter-spacing: 0.0px} -->You must use at least 4 sources of information (not including data or graphics).</p>
<p><strong>At least two</strong> of your sources MUST be from academic (preferably geographic) sources. These can be journal articles or books; blogs and websites do not count!</p>
<p>In-line citations are REQUIRED for all information—including direct quotations, summaries, and paraphrasing—in the text of your paper that is not original. A bibliography containing all of your references must be included at the end of your paper.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is NOT a valid source. Most articles on Wikipedia include citations with references to their source information, which you may use.</p>
<p>Websites used as sources should follow the guidelines discussed in class.</p>
<h2>Assessment</h2>
<p><!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times} p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 12.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times} span.s1 {letter-spacing: 0.0px} -->Papers will be assessed based on geographic content and analysis as well as mechanics. Refer to the grading rubric for a breakdown of the grade, available as a PDF here: <a href="/geh101/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2011/02/term-paper-rubric.pdf">Term Paper Rubric</a></p>
<p>If you struggle with writing mechanics, it is highly recommended that you visit the Academic Support Center for Excellence, have a peer proof read your paper, or meet with me individually to work on making your paper more readable and comprehensible.</p>
<h2>Dates</h2>
<p><strong>March 21, 11:59pm: </strong>Brief outline and bibliography due via email<br />
<strong>April 11, 11:59pm: </strong>Final term paper due via email</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a <a href="http://geh101.wordpress.com/2010/09/27/basic-reading-writing-and-peer-editing-guide/">previous post</a>, I provided some resources to help students with the writing process. However, I realized that those resources didn&#8217;t sufficiently cover pre-writing and outlining, and since an outline is due before the next class, I decided to provide some additional resources to help you get started with your outlines.</p>
<p>The Purdue University Online Writing Lab is a wonderful resource for all stages of the writing process for students of all levels. Their sections on outlining and prewriting are particularly useful:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/673/01/">Prewriting I</a></li>
<li><a href="http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/673/02/">Prewriting II</a></li>
<li><a href="http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/673/03/">Prewriting III</a></li>
<li><a href="http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/544/02/">Why and How to Outline</a></li>
<li><a href="http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/544/03/">Types of Outlines</a></li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the objectives of the term papers is to think beyond the information found in Wikipedia or the New York Times. This means engaging with current research about the topic to see how other scholars and researchers are thinking about the topic and the types of questions they&#8217;re trying to understand.</p>
<p>To this end, you are required to use at least 1-2 sources from scholarly journal articles, such as those in the Annals of the American Association of Geographers. You can search for articles using <a href="http://scholar.google.com/">Google Scholar</a> or the <a href="http://www.lehman.edu/library/">Lehman College library</a>. If you search Google Scholar from an on-campus computer, you should be able to download a PDF of the article since CUNY provides access to many journal archives. Similarly, if you search from within the Lehman College library website, you should be able to access the articles directly as PDFs.</p>
<p>As usual, if you have questions, please send me an email or speak with me outside of class.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Celina Su, an Urban Studies professor at Brooklyn College, has a great guide to help students with critical reading, writing, and peer-editing. I highly recommend students check out the guide. Even if some of the ideas seem really basic and obvious, it never hurts to be reminded that we should be doing these things on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Check out Celina Su&#8217;s <a href="http://www.burmeserefugeeproject.org/celinasu/reading.html">Reading</a>, <a href="http://www.burmeserefugeeproject.org/celinasu/writing.html">Writing</a>, and <a href="http://www.burmeserefugeeproject.org/celinasu/editing.html">Peer-Editing</a> guides.</p>
<p>Paisley Currah, another Brooklyn College professor, also has a more in-depth <a href="http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/polisci/pcurrah/writing.htm">guide for writing</a> that covers topics such as style, mechanics, using references, as well as developing your arguments.</p>
<p>And per usual, you can always discuss these things with me in person or via email if you find yourself needing additional assistance.</p>
